## Description

My goal in building this project was to create a responsive, multi-page website using HTML and CSS. I decided to build a website pertaining to something I love and have a passion for, which is hairless dogs. 

The website offers information about hairless dogs. There are currently only four breeds featured, but I hope to add more in the future. The website also has a functioning contact form. 

Links that have not been set up with a true address return a surprise modal and links that do have a true address open webpages within the same tab. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

## User Stories
As a prospective dog owner with allergies, I want to evaluate different hairless dog breeds so that I can decide if a hairless dog would be right for me.

As a hairless dog breeder, I want to provide information about hairless dogs so that I can educate my clients on proper hairless dog maintenance and care.  

As a hairless dog owner, I want to know about possible health issues my dog may have so that I can get my dog screened for these issues and properly deal with them.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements that I want to make include (1) improving responsiveness of the website, (2) adding feature that makes links open in a new tab, and (3) eventually adding a directory that allows people to search for responsible breeders and shelters in their area to find hairless dogs.
